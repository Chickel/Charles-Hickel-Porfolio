I am currently a student at Ivytech Community college earning my associates degree in software application development. Currently II have earned a certificate in software application development and am two credit hours away from my associates degree. I am currently employed at Walmart as a overnight stocker. However since i am almost finished with my degree I am looking to get out and get some experience and hopefully a new job within my given field. I am a hard worker with a very creative mind. My goal is to eventually become a video game designer but for now just looking for experience in programming or graphic design. That being said I have worked in various languages such as
